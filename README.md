# Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics and Control System

The mission of this project is the stabilization and pointing of a CubeSat 6U after it has been put into orbit. In particular, the mission is divided into two phases: De-Tumbling and Earth Pointing.
The De-Tumbling phase consists in the decrease of the angular speed, whereas the Earth Pointing phase consists in rotating the spacecraft in such a way as to always point the planet in every moment of the orbit. In the first phase of mission, the solar panels are closed so that the reduction in angular velocity is easier as the moments of inertia are smaller. In the second part however, the solar panels open to collect energy. For the sake of simplification, the opening of the panels is considered instantaneous.
The chosen orbit is circular and equatorial with an altitude of 800 km. it can therefore be defined as Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The purpose of the mission finally falls into the category of Earth observation.
